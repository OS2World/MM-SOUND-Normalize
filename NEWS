Please send Normalize bug reports to cvaill@cs.columbia.edu.


Version 0.5.2

* Fixed bug with -c option.  It was not turning compression on.
* Fixed bug in dealing with corrupt files.


Version 0.5.1

* All gain values in dB, all amplitudes in dBFS (option `--fractions'
  added to get gains and amplitudes as fractions of 1.0 instead)
* Added -c option to turn on compression
* No longer do compression if we don't need to
* The -n option now prints out peak values and gains
* Keep track of clippings, even when using lookup table
* Fixed bugs with 24 and 32 bit WAV files
* Other minor bugfixes


Version 0.5

* Added dynamic range compression instead of clipping
* Added --peak option to normalize by peak instead of RMS
* The -a option now also accepts values in decibels less than full
  scale (dBFS)
* Speed improvement
* normalize-mp3 script now skips files that are already normalized
* Other minor bugfixes and cleanups


Version 0.4.1

* Bug fixed: decibel gains supplied to -g option were doubled in v0.4.
* Bug fixed: report of needed adjustment in dB was halved in v0.4 (it
  was consistent with -g option bug).  Adjustments calculated by v0.4
  should not be used with any other version.


Version 0.4

* Added ability to compute volume of data from standard input
* Adjustments now measured in decibels
* Already-normalized files are now skipped
* Files are adjusted in place, no longer use temporary files
* Minor bugfixes
* Various code cleanups


Version 0.3.4

* Bug fixed in handling files less than one second long
* Added normalize-mp3 script
* Various code cleanups


Version 0.3.3

* Bug fixed in statistical volume analysis for mix mode.


Version 0.3.2

* Fix for bug with long filenames.


Version 0.3.1

* Initial public release.
